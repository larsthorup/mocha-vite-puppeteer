[![Build Status](https://github.com/larsthorup/mocha-vite-puppeteer/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/larsthorup/mocha-vite-puppeteer/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

Run your [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) front-end tests with the [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) bundler and the [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/) browser launcher.

"mocha-vite-puppeteer" can be used with any existing Vite project and is not specific to Vue, React or any other front-end library. Both JavaScript and TypeScript is supported via Vite.

## Install

```bash
npm install mocha-vite-puppeteer
```

## Run

First add some test files using Mocha, e.g. `Counter.test.jsx`:

```js
import { expect } from "chai";
import React from "react";
import { render, screen } from "@testing-library/react";

import Counter from "./Counter";

describe("Counter", () => {
  it("should count", () => {
    render(<Counter />);
    const countButton = screen.getByText("count is: 0");
    countButton.click();
    screen.getByText("count is: 1");
  });
});
```

Remember to add any additional dependencies used by the tests, in this case:

```bash
$ npm install chai @testing-library/react
```

Note: "mocha-vite-puppeteer" is not React specific, and should work just as well with Vue, Preact or any other front-end library supported by Vite.

Then run your tests, bundled with Vite, in Puppeteer with:

```bash
$ npx mocha-vite-puppeteer
```

You will see output similar to:

```text
  Counter
    âœ“ should count
  1 passing (24ms)
```

An exit code of 0 indicates that all tests passes. In general, the exit code indicates the number of failed tests, which can be used in CI pipelines.

For now the following built-in reporters are supported:

- dot
- json
- json-stream
- list
- spec
- tap

And also the following custom reporter is supported:

- [mocha-junit-reporter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mocha-junit-reporter)

You can optionally specify a JSON file with reporter options:

```bash
$ npx mocha-vite-puppeteer --reporter mocha-junit-reporter --reporter-options mocha-junit-reporter.config.json
```

By default `mocha-vite-puppeteer` will use a default "test.html" to configure mocha and load your test-files. But you can also write your own `test.html` placed next to `index.html`. Here is an example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <body>
    <script type="module">
      import "mocha";
      mocha.setup({ ui: "bdd" });
    </script>
    <script type="module">
      const modules = import.meta.globEager("/src/**/*.test.{js,jsx}");
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

| --verbose         | -v    | false       | Enables verbose reporting from Mocha-Vite-Puppeteer. Useful for debugging these flags and inputs. |
| --debug           | -d    | false       | Sets debug mode for Mocha-Vite-Puppeteer. Automatically disabled puppeteer headless mode.         |
| --config          | -c    | undefined   | Advanced config options. See section below for details                                            |

| --coverage        |       |             | Instrument and collect code coverage during test. Use "nyc" for reporting                         |

  <summary>Advanced Configuration</summary>

```
{
  "port": 3010,
  "reporter": "dot",
  "coverage": true,
  "puppeteer": {
    "launchOptions": {
      "headless": false,
      ...
    }
  },
  "istanbul": {
    "include": ["src/*"]
  }
}
```

The base-level of the object accepts any flag above, except config of course.

The key "puppeteer" can be used for additional puppeteer configuration.
The puppeteer currently only accepts the key launchOptions.
see the [puppeteer docs on launch options](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/blob/main/docs/api.md#puppeteerlaunchoptions) for a full list of launch options available.

The key "istanbul" can be used for additional code coverage configuration, see the section on Code Coverage below.

</details>

## Code coverage

When using the `--coverage` option, a raw coverage report is produced in a `.nyc_output` folder. To get a nicely formatted report, you will have to use the [nyc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nyc) CLI, such as:

```
nyc report --reporter=text-summary --reporter=html --exclude-after-remap false
```

Instrumentation for coverage analysis is handled by [vite-plugin-istanbul](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vite-plugin-istanbul). Any options needed for your project to work with this plugin can be added via the mocha-vite-puppeteer config file under the "istanbul" key, see Advanced configuration above.

The `--exclude-after-remap false` option for `nyc` is needed because `vite` handle all transpilation (JSX, TypeScript etc) pre-instrumentation.
